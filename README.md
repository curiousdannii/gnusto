**Gnusto** is a JIT compiler and virtual machine for the Z-Machine, originally written by Marnanel Thurman.

# History
Marnanel Thurman originally designed Gnusto as a Mozilla/Firefox extension for a full Z-Machine interpreter. He and a few others worked on it for several years, but stopped in 2005.

In 2008 Atul Varma used the VM engine code and built a new interpreter interface around it. [Parchment](http://iplayif.com/), as it was named, was no longer a extension, but now a webpage that could run in any (modern) browser.

Dannii Willis started working on Parchment in late 2008. In early 2009 he decided to again separate Gnusto from Parchment, and moved its development [to GitHub](https://github.com/curiousdannii/parchment).  In 2011 he started working on [ifvms.js](https://github.com/curiousdannii/ifvms.js) instead. Gnusto is no longer maintained.
